## Hashing Utility Project

This project demonstrates the usage of various cryptographic hash algorithms in Java. It includes utilities for:
Hashing a string using different algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256).
Verifying if a string matches a given hash.
Generating salted hashes.
Features

MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 hashing algorithms.
Salted hashing for additional security.
Unit tests for each functionality.
Getting Started

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hash-utility.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd hash-utility
Compile the Java files:
javac Main.java HashingUtils.java HashAlgorithm.java
Run the program:
java Main
Testing

The program includes unit tests for:
Hashing strings.
Verifying hash matches.
Testing salted hashes.
All tests are run automatically when you execute the Main class.
